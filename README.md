Gondola is a toolbox to facilitate Brain network analysis (and exploration) in Matlab.
Gondola provides an easy structure to develop code-based network analysis to allow easy to write and reproducible code. It also works a small "boat" that allows to navigate between other existing toolboxes for network analysis and plotting (Brain Connectivity Toolbox, Network Based Statistics, BrainNetViewer).
